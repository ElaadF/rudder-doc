= Extend inventories with custom data

== Use case

Rudder provides inventories containing generic information about
nodes hardware, configuration and installed software, allowing to classify nodes into
relevant groups and apply different policies.
But sometimes, the content of these inventories is not enough, and you
may want to *add custom data* that could be a node property, but *comes
directly from the node*.

In this case, you can use the xref:reference:usage:advanced_node_management.adoc#extend-nodes-inventory[inventory extension hook mechanism].
Additional data will appear as *read-only node properties in the Rudder server*, ready
to be used like the rest of the properties (to classify nodes or be part
of actual policies content).

We will here describe a complete example, allowing to collect information
about known *CPU vulnerabilities* on the nodes.

== Policy design

To be able to use our custom data we need to:

* write a script collecting the information
* deploy the script to the relevant nodes
* use the defined property to create groups

== Inventory extension script

An inventory extension script can be written in any language, it just needs to be an
executable file placed in `/var/rudder/hooks.d` that outputs a json object. It will be called at each 
inventory, and its output will be added into it.

NOTE: Read the xref:reference:usage:advanced_node_management.adoc#extend-nodes-inventory[dedicated section]
for more details.

We'll just have to extract vulnerabilities information provided by the kernel in 
`/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities`. We'll not return the raw data, but
rework it to make it easily usable on the server. We'll:

* Determine the status of the node for each known vulnerability
* Add details in a separate variable for mode advanced handling

In our case, we have written a small python script (the https://github.com/Normation/rudder-tools/blob/master/contrib/inventory-hooks/cpu_vulnerabilities.py[script] and its https://github.com/Normation/rudder-tools/blob/master/contrib/inventory-hooks/cpu_vulnerabilities.adoc[documentation]) that outputs our CPU vulnerabilities in the
following format:

[source,json]
----
{
  "cpu_vulnerabilities": {
    "spectre_v2": {
      "status": "vulnerable",
      "details": "Retpoline without IBPB"
    },
    "spectre_v1": {
      "status": "mitigated",
      "details": "Load fences"
    },
    "meltdown": {
      "status": "mitigated",
      "details": "PTI"
    }
  }
}

====

We have a https://github.com/Normation/rudder-tools/tree/master/contrib/inventory-hooks[central place] to allow sharing your inventory extension scripts, if your 
are writing one, please consider contributing it! (Just open a _pull request_ directly on the repository,
your script doesn't have to be perfect!).

== Deploy the script

Here we can simply use any mean allowing to copy files from the root server to the nodes.
We will create a dedicated directory in `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/shared-files`
on the server and copy the hooks to the right nodes.

An good option (allowing different inventory on different machines)
is to create a dedicated technique like:

image::cpu_technique.png[Technique to deploy inventory hooks]

(applied permissions here are `root:root` and `755`).

Then you can add a directive for each hooks:

image::cpu_directive.png[Directive to deploy CPU vulnerabilities hook]

For example, in our example, we will very likely apply this directive to all our physical nodes.

== Use the defined properties

In our case, we want to define groups identifying vulnerable nodes.

image::cpu_prop.png[Defined property]

To use the data properly, we need to extract information from the object,
and cannot rely on a simple regex. We will use the
xref:reference:usage:node_management.adoc#search-nodes-properties-json-path[JSON path syntax].

For example to select nodes known to be vulnerable to `spectre_v2`, we need to use the `cpu_vulnerabilities:$.spectre_v2[?(@.status=='vulnerable')]` JSON path query in group form that
will only select nodes that have a `spectre_v2` object with the `vulnerable status`.

image::cpu_group.png[Defined group]

You can then apply rules to these groups (upgrade CPU microcode, plan reboots, etc.)

[NOTE]
====

Inventory data is updated daily, if you want to gather updated information, 
run `rudder agent inventory` on the target nodes to se changes reflected in Rudder
server.
