= Enforce a line is present in a file only once 

Enforcing a line to be present in a single occurrence in a file is not an easy process to automate
if you can't totally control the content of the file and need to let it
editable by users.

The most powerful way to edit a file is to use the *File content* technique, because it allows
making different changes on a file at once, and only modifying it after computing the resulting content.

The whole logic to edit a file so it contain only one occurrence of a line is:

* Add the line, so it will be added if missing
* Replace lines that looks almost like our line by the line
* Delete all duplicated lines 

With these 3 steps, you will end with one line! So, here is a small example: let's say you
want `/etc/sysconfig/sysctl` to contain line `ENABLE_SYSRQ="yes"`

You will need to create a directive based on the *File content* technique with the following content:
