== Dependencies

When using syslog reporting, Rudder agent requires that a syslog server
is installed on the node. This syslog server can be either:

* syslogd
* syslog-ng
* rsyslog

One of them is generally installed by default, but it may not be the case with minimal images.
In this case you should install one (preferably syslog-ng or rsyslog).
