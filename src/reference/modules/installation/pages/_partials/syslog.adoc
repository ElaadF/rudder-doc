== Dependencies

If you need to use syslog reporting, which is not the general case,
Rudder agent requires that a syslog server
is installed on the node. This syslog server can be either
`syslogd`, `syslog-ng` or `rsyslog`.

One of them is generally installed by default, but it may not be the case with minimal images.
In this case you should install one (preferably `syslog-ng` or `rsyslog`).
