=== Install Rudder Relay (optional)

Relay servers can be added to Rudder, for example to manage a DMZ or to isolate specific
nodes from the main environment for security reasons. 

Relay server's purpose is to solve a simple problem: sometimes, one would want to manage
multiple networks from Rudder, without having to allow all the subnet access to the other
for security reasons. A solution for this would be to have a kind of "Rudder" proxy that
would be relaying information between the subnet and the main Rudder server. This is the
reason relay servers were created.

Using a relay, you are able to:

- Separate your Rudder architecture into separate entities that still report to one server
- Prevent laxist security exceptions to the Rudder server
- Ease maintenance

The first part is to be done on the machine that will become a relay server.
The procedure will:

- Add the machine as a regular node
- Configure the relay components (Syslog, Apache HTTPd, CFEngine)
- Switch this node to the relay server role (from the root server point of view)

==== On the relay

To begin, please install a regular Rudder agent on the OS, following the
xref:10_installation/11_install_agent/00_install_agent.adoc#install-agent[installation instructions], and install the 'rudder-server-relay'
package in addition to the 'rudder-agent' package.

To complete this step, please make sure that your node is configured successfully
and appears in your Rudder web interface.

==== On the root server

You have to tell the Rudder Root server that a node will be a relay. To do so,
launch the rudder-node-to-relay script on the root server, supplying the UUID of the
host to be considered as a relay. You can find the UUID of your node with the
'rudder agent info' command.

==== Validation

When every step has completed successfully:

- The Rudder root server will recognize the new node as a relay
- It will generate specific promises for the relay
- The relay will update and switch to his new role

This is an example of node details pane showing a relay server. Note the "Role:
Rudder relay server" part that shows that the machine has successfully changed
from a node to a relay.

==== Adding nodes to a relay server

When you have at least one relay, you will likely want to add nodes
on it.

You then have two possible cases:

- You want to switch an already existing node to the relay
- You want to add a new one

The procedure on both cases is the same, you have to:

- Create / update the file /var/rudder/cfengine-community/policy_server.dat
with the IP address or the fully qualified domain name of the relay server
(instead of the root server)

----

echo "rudder-relay.example.com" > /var/rudder/cfengine-community/policy_server.dat

----


- Trigger an inventory immediately to make sure the node is registered correctly

After those steps, the node should be registered correctly on your Rudder
infrastructure.
