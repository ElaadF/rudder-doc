==== Install Rudder Root server on Debian or Ubuntu

===== Add the Rudder packages repository

Rudder requires Java RE (version 8 at least) which is not packaged by default on Debian 8 nor Ubuntu 14.04.

The Java RE 8 for Debian or Ubuntu can be found through Oracle's website: https://www.java.com

Then run the following commands as root:

----

echo "deb http://www.rudder-project.org/apt-4.3/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rudder.list
apt-get update

----

This will add the package repository and finally update the local package cache.

===== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

apt-get install rudder-server-root
