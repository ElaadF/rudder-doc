==== Cloud compatibility

The agent provides an abstraction that permits a high level management of the infrastructure.
This abstraction is independant of the underlying hardware. This also works for the cloud -
we can define configuration rules in Rudder that will be applied as well inside a cloud instance as in a virtual server or in a physical machine of a datacenter.

Any cloud instance based on one of the supported operating system is automatically supported.
