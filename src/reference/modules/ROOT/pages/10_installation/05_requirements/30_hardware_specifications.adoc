==== Hardware specifications for Rudder Agent

Rudder agent has a very small footprint, and only consumes:

* 10 to 20 MB of RAM during an agent run
* a few kB on the network to check or update its policies
* a few kB on the network to report
* around 100 MB of disk space for the installed files and the workspace

These figures will vary depending on your configuration (backup retention,
number of configured components to check, etc...).


[[server-hardware-requirements]]
==== Hardware specifications and sizing for Rudder Root Server

A dedicated server is strongly recommended, either physical or virtual with at least one dedicated core.
Rudder Server runs on both 32 (if available) and 64 bit versions of every supported Operating System.

[NOTE]

====

Rudder does not fear big infrastructures. It is currently used in production in
infrastructure with more than *7000* nodes.

====

===== Memory

The required amount of RAM mainly depends on the number of managed nodes. A general rule for the minimal value on a stand-alone server is:

* less than 50 nodes: 2 GB
* between 50 and 1000 nodes: 4 GB
* more than 1000 nodes: 4 GB + 1 GB of RAM by 500 nodes above 1000.

When managing more than 1000 nodes, we also recommend you to use a multiserver
installation for Rudder as described in chapter <<multiserver-rudder, Multiserver Rudder>>.

When your server has more than 2 GB of RAM, you have to configure the RAM allocated
to the Java Virtual Machine as explained in the section
<<_configure_ram_allocated_to_jetty, about webapplication RAM configuration>>.

When your server has more than 4 GB, you may need to also tune the PostgresSQL
server, as explained in the <<_optimize_postgresql_server, Optimize PostgreSQL Server>>
section.

[TIP]

====

As an example, a Rudder server which manages 2600 nodes (with a lot of policies
checked) will need:

* A server with 8 GB of RAM,
* 4 GB of RAM will be allocated to the JVM.

In our load-tests, with such a configuration, the server is not stressed and
the user experience is good.

====

===== Disk

The PostgreSQL database will take up most disk space needed by Rudder. The storage
necessary for the database can be estimated by counting around
150 to 400 kB by Directive, by Node and by day of retention of node's
execution reports (the default is 4 days):

----
max_space = number of Directives * number of Nodes * retention duration in days * 400 kB
----

For example, a default installation with 500 nodes and an average of
50 Directives by node, should require between *14 GB and 38 GB* of disk space
for PostgreSQL.

Follow the <<_reports_retention, Reports Retention>> section to configure the
retention duration.


[WARNING]

====

Be careful to correctly size your */var* partition. Compliance data are growing
fast, and PostgreSQL doesn't like at all to encounter a write error because
the disk is full. It is also adviced to set-up your monitoring to check for
available space on that partition.
