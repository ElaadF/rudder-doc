==== Enforce a line is present in a file only once 

Enforcing that a line to be present in a single occurence in a file is not an easy process to automate. Providing templates is an easy way to achieve this but not always possible.

If you don't want to use a template, you can use Technique *Enforce a File content* to control the content of a file.

The whole logic to edit a file so it contain only one occurence of a line is:

* Add the line, so it will be added if missing)
* Replace line that looks almost like our line by the line
* Delete all duplicated lines 

With these 3 steps, You will end with one line!

So, here is a small example: let's say you want /etc/sysconfig/sysctl to contain line 'ENABLE_SYSRQ="yes"'

You will need to create a Directive based on Enforce a File content with the following content:
