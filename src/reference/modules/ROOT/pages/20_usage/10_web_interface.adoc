=== Authentication

When accessing the Rudder web interface, a login / password is required.  The
default account is "admin" (Password: admin).

You can change the user accounts by following the xref:30_basic_administration/80_user_management.adoc#user-management[User management]
procedure.

=== Presentation of Rudder Web Interface

The web interface is organised according to the concepts described earlier. It
is divided in three logical parts: Node Management, Configuration Management
and Administration.

==== Rudder Home

The home page summarizes the content of the other parts and provides quick links
for the most common actions.
