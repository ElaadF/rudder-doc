=== Best Practices for generic methods

==== Naming convention

   * A generic method should be named as this:
       * The first part is the name of the item being defined or configured (a package, a file, a condition, etc.), the second
         part qualifies what is being done
       * `item_state` whenever a state name makes sense (like `package_present`)
       * `item_subitem` when we are configuring a subitem (like `user_home`)
       * `item_subitem_state` whenever a state name makes sense for a subitem (like `file_lines_present`)
       * `item_from_source` whenever it is converted from something else, replacing source by the type of the source (`command`, `file`, etc.)
       * `item_action` if it is an action (like `service_restart`)
    * Avoid useless words, and keep things short
    * When adding a more specific method, add a qualifier at the end
