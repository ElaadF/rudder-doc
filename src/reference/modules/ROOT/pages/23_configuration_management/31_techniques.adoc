=== Techniques

==== Concepts

A Technique defines a set of operations and configurations to reach the
desired behaviour. This includes the initial set-up, but also a regular check on
the parameters, and automatic repairs (when possible).

All the Techniques are built with the possibility to change only part of a
service configuration: each parameter may be either active, either set on the
"Don't change" value, that will let the default values or in place. This allows
for a progressive deployment of the configuration management.

Finally, the Techniques will generate a set of reports which are sent to
the Rudder Root Server, which will let you analyse the percentage of compliance
of your policies, and soon, detailed reports on their application.

==== Manage the Techniques

The Techniques shipped with Rudder are presented in a library that you can
reorganize in *Configuration > Techniques*. The library
is organized in two parts: the available Techniques, and the selection
made by the user.

include::../glossary/active-techniques.txt[]

==== Create new Techniques

The standard library only provides the most common Techniques. You can create
new Technique with the <<technique-editor, Technique Editor>>.
