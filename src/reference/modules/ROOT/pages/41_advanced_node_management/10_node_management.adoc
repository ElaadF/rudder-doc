=== Node management

==== Reinitialize policies for a Node

To reinitialize the policies for a Node, delete the local copy of the Applied
Policies fetched from the Rudder Server, and create a new local copy of the
initial promises.

----

rudder agent reset

----

At next run of the Rudder Agent (it runs every five minutes), the initial promises will be used. 

[CAUTION]

====

Use this procedure with caution: the Applied Policies of a Node should never get
broken, unless some major change has occurred on the Rudder infrastructure, like
a full reinstallation of the Rudder Server.

====

==== Completely reinitialize a Node

You may want to completely reinitialize a Node to make it seen as a new node
on the server, for example after cloning a VM.

[WARNING]

====

This command will permanently delete your node uuid and keys, and no configuration will
be applied before re-accepting and configuring the node on the server.

====

The command to reinitialize a Node is:

----

rudder agent reinit

----

This command will delete all local agent data, including its uuid and keys, and
also reset the agent internal state. The only configuration kept is the server
hostname or ip configured in +policy_server.dat+. It will also send an inventory
to the server, which will treat it as a new node inventory. 

==== Change the agent run schedule

By default, the agent runs on all nodes every 5 minutes. You can modify this value in
 *Settings* -> *General* page in *Agent Run Schedule* section, as well as the "splay time"
across nodes (a random delay that alters scheduled run time, intended to spread
load across nodes).

This settings can also be modified Node by Node, allowing you to customize the agent behavior (Node with little ressource like a Raspberry Pi or with limited bandwith). To do that, go into the Node details in the *Settings* tab

[WARNING]

====

When reducing notably the run interval length, reporting can be in 'No report' state
until the next run of the agent, which can take up to the previous (longer) interval.
