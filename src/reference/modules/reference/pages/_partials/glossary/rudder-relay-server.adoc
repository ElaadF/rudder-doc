Rudder Relay Server::

Relay servers are an optional component in a Rudder architecture.
They can act as a proxy for all network communications between Rudder agents
and a Rudder server. This enables them to be installed in a remote datacenter,
or inside a restricted network zone, to limit the network flows required to
use Rudder.
