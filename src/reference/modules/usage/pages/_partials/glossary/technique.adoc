Technique::

This is a configuration skeleton, adapted to a function or a particular service
(e.g. DNS resolver configuration). This skeleton includes the configuration logic
for this function or service, and can be set according to a list of variables
(in the same example: IP addresses of DNS servers, the default search box, ...)
