= Advanced configuration management

== Policy generation

Each time a change occurs in the Rudder interface, having an impact on the
policy needed by a node, it is necessary to regenerate the modified
policies for every impacted node. By default this process is launched after each
change.

The process of policy generation:

* Use configured policies and information about the nodes to generate
  the files defining the policy that reflects the desired state
* Compute and store expected reports that will be produced when executing these policies
* Check the validity of the generated policies
* Replace the old version of the policies by the new one for impacted node
* Restart the policy server on the Rudder central server is authorizations have changed

image::objects-used-in-generation.png[Objects and parameters used in policy generation]

You can customize some of these actions and add new ones using the xref:usage:advanced_configuration_management.adoc#_server_event_hooks[Server Event Hooks].

image::policy_generation.png[Status of policy generation]

=== +Update policies+ button

The button +Update policies+ on the top right of the screen, in the +Status+ menu, allows you to force
the regeneration of the policies. As changes in the inventory of the nodes are
not automatically taken into account by Rudder, this feature can be useful
after some changes impacting the inventory information.

=== +Regenerate all policies+ button

The button +Regenerate all policies+ on the top right of the screen, in the +Status+ menu, allows you to force
the regeneration of all policies. It will clear all internal caches, and force a complete
computation of the policies. This is generally useful to make sure everything is correct after a problem
on the central server.


== Understanding how Technique Editor works

In this chapter, we are giving an overview about how the Technique Editor works and how it is
integrated with the main Rudder application.

=== Directory layout

As explained in http://www.ncf.io/, ncf uses a structured directory tree composed of several layers of logic,
from internal libraries to Techniques and user services. All the files and logic in these folders will be named
"library" for simplicity

ncf directory structure exists in two root folders:

* `/usr/share/ncf/tree`
** This is the standard library installation folder. It is created and updated by the
   the ncf package. This folder will be completely overwritten when you update ncf
   package so you should never modify anything here: it will be lost at some point.

* `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf`
** This is were you add your own ncf Generic Methods and Techniques.
   Techniques created with the Technique Editor will be located here, and both
   Generic and Techniques in that place will be accessible in the Technique Editor
   alongside what is provided by the standard library.

=== Sharing ncf code with nodes

To share those folders to all nodes, Rudder makes a copy of these folders in two
places:

* `/var/rudder/ncf`, for part common to all nodes - so NOT techniques,
  ** `/var/rudder/ncf/local` is a copy of node-independant directories from
     `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf`, so almost everything *BUT*
     `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf/50_techniques`.
  ** `/var/rudder/ncf/common` is a copy `/usr/share/ncf/tree`
* `/var/rudder/share/xxxx-yyyy-node-id-zzzz/rules/cfengine-community/Technique_Name/1.0/Technique_Name.cf`
  for techniques, with one directory for each technique applied to the node.
* `/var/rudder/share/xxxx-yyyy-node-id-zzzz/rules/cfengine-community/rudder_expected_reports.csv`
  contains information about report expected for all ncf techniques applied to that node.



Files in `/var/rudder/ncf` are synchronized automatically by the "rudder agent update"
command when the agent runs on the server. So any modification done in files
in these directories will be lost at the next synchronization.

Files under `/var/rudder/share/` are updated during policy generation.

A node updates its ncf local library by copying the content of these two folders
during its policy update phase.

=== From ncf Technique Editor to Rudder Techniques and back

Here we will explain how the Technique Editor integration to Rudder is done to
transform ncf techniques into full fledge Rudder one. We will also get the
big picture of the web flow and the resulting events triggered on Rudder servier
side.

Each action in the Technique Editor interface produces requests to an API defined over ncf.

All of the requests are authenticated thanks to a token passed in the JSESSIONID header.
The token is generated when an authenticated user is connected to the Rudder interface
(typically thanks to his browser).

That token is shared to the Technique Editor interface, which itself passes the
JSESSIONID header to all requests.

If you have authentication issue, check that your Rudder session is not expired.

Get request::

Get request will get all Techniques and Generic Methods in a path passed as parameters of the
request in the "path" javascript variable:

https://your.rudder.server/ncf-builder/#!?path=/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf

Get requests are triggered when accessing Technique editor.

The ncf API will parse all files in the parameter path by running "cf-promises -pjson" on all Techniques,
checking that all Techniques are correctly formed.

The ncf API will also look to all Generic Methods description data to build the catalog of available
Generic Methods.

The resulting information are sent back to the Technique Editor for displaying.

Post requests::

Post requests are issued when a Technique is created, modified or deleted.
They will only work on Techniques available in the path given in parameter.

They are triggered when clicking on save/delete button.

The main difference with get requests is that hooks are launched before and after the action is made.

We will see all hooks behavior in the following dedicated hooks section.

=== Hooks

On each POST request, pre- and post- hooks are executed by the Technique Editor.
These hooks are used for the Rudder integration to help transform pure ncf Techniques into Rudder one.

- pre-hooks are located in: `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf/pre-hooks.d`
- post-hooks are located in: `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf/post-hooks.d`

As of March 2015, we have two post-hooks defined and no pre-hooks:

* `post.write_technique.commit.sh`
** It commits the Technique newly created into Rudder Git configuration repository
located in `/var/rudder/configuration-repository`.
* `post.write_technique.rudderify.sh`
** It generates a valid Rudder Technique from a the newly created Technique and reloads Rudder
Technique Library so that updates are taken into account.

If you want to run post hooks by hand, you can use the following command:

      /var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf/post-hooks.d/post.write_technique.commit.sh /var/rudder/configuration-repository bundle_name

[[_node_properties]]
== Node properties

Node properties can be found in the "properties" tab of each node in Rudder.

Node properties can be modified using Rudder's API, see https://docs.rudder.io/api/#api-Nodes-updateNodeProperties

Properties can also be defined on the node itself, to override locally properties.

Each property is a key=value pair. The value can be a string or a well-formatted JSON data structure.

Some examples:
`datacenter=Paris`
`datacenter= { "id": "FRA1", "name": "Colo 1, Paris", "location": "Paris, France", "dns_suffix": "paris.example.com" }`


=== Using properties

You can use node properties almost everywhere in Rudder:

* in directive parameters
* in the technique editor
* in your own techniques and generic methods

To use a property, simply use the variable node.properties with the variable call syntax.

Example with a property named 'datacenter':

----

${node.properties[datacenter]}

----

In a mustache template, use:

----

{{{vars.node.properties.datacenter}}}

----

=== Local override

The agent searches for optionnal properties files `/var/rudder/local/properties.d/*.json`, and will override existing properties.

As a result, if you have node properties defined server side as
`"sysctls_postgresql":{"kernel.shmall":"903330","kernel.shmmax":"3700041320"}` and
`"vm":{"vm.dirty_ratio":"10"}`

and a local property file `/var/rudder/local/properties.d/postgresql_config.json` as

----

{
  "properties":
  {
    "sysctls_postgresql": {
      "kernel.shmmax":"5368709120"
    }
  }

}

----

The resulting properties will be:

`"sysctls_postgresql":{"kernel.shmmax":"5368709120"}` and
`"vm":{"vm.dirty_ratio":"10"}`

`sysctls_postgresql` has been overriden by local property, and `vm` has been left untouched.
Note that it is an override, as the semantic of merging is not deterministic with literal values, and it does not allow to unset values. If you need to merge, please refer to the next paragraph.


=== Merging properties

If you want to merge server defined properties with local defined properties, rather than override them, you will need to use the generic method variable_dict_merge_tolerant to define which variables you need to merge, and define the local variables in a different namespace than properties.

For instance, if you have defined in the node properties the following properties

`"sysctls_postgresql":{"kernel.shmall":"903330","kernel.shmmax":"3700041320"}`

and you wish to merge these values on a node with locally defined variable, to change the value of kernel.shmmax and set the value of kernel.shmmni, you can define the file /var/rudder/local/properties.d/postgresql_config.json with the following content

----

{
    "local_properties":
    {
        "sysctls_postgresql": {
            "kernel.shmmax":"5368709120",
            "kernel.shmmni":"4096"
        }
    }

}

----

and use the generic method `variable_dict_merge_tolerant` to merge `node.properties[sysctls_postgresql]` and `node.local_properties[sysctls_postgresql]`, and set the result in merged_properties.sysctls_postgresql (for instance): `variable_dict_merge_tolerant("merged_properties", "sysctls_postgresql", "node.properties[sysctls_postgresql]", "node.local_properties[sysctls_postgresql]")`

As a result, merged_properties.sysctls_postgresql will contain

---

"sysctls_postgresql": {
    "kernel.shmall":"903330",
    "kernel.shmmax":"5368709120",
    "kernel.shmmni":"4096"
}


---



=== Under the hood

On the server, one or more properties files are written for each node in the
`/var/rudder/share/<uuid>/rules/cfengine-community/properties.d/` directory.
This directory is then copied to each node by the agent with all other policy files.

In the agent, properties are made available in the `node.<namespace>` container that contains the values.
Those values are read from
`/var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs/properties/*.json`. All files are taken
in order and override the previous ones - the last one wins.

The agent searches for optionnal properties files `/var/rudder/local/properties.d/*.json`, and will define variables
or override existing properties.

Each file must contain at least 2 levels of JSON content, the first level is the namespace level
and the second level is the key level.

The namespace name must be an ASCII name that doesn't start with `_` and must
match the following regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`

For example:

----

{
  "properties":
  {
    "datacenter": "Paris",
    "environment": "production",
    "customer": "Normation"
  }
}

----

The merge is a first level merge done at the namespace level. This means that:

* a key in a namespace is fully overridden by the same key in the same namespace in a later file.
* a key in a namespace is never overriden by the same key in a different namespace
* a key that is overriden never retains original data even if it is a data container itself

The result key is available in the `node.<namespace>` data variable. A usage
example:

----
${node.properties[datacenter]}
----

To get the original data (for debug only) there is the
`properties.property_<fileid>` variable. A usage example:

----
${properties.property__var_rudder_cfengine_community_inputs_properties_d_properties_json[properties][datacenter]}
----

[[_node_properties_expansion_in_directives]]
== Node properties expansion in directives

It is possible to use properties defined on nodes to build Directive values in all fields. The
resulting values will be computed during policy generation, and can therefore
provide unique values for each node or be used in JavaScript expressions.

Properties on nodes are defined using Rudder's REST API, with the 'Update Node properties' API call.
More details in our https://docs.rudder.io/api[API documentation].

Properties can also be defined directly on the nodes, by creating properties files
`/var/rudder/local/properties.d/*.json/`


=== Feature availability

This feature was introduced in Rudder 3.1.14, Rudder 3.2.7 and Rudder 4.0.0.

If you upgraded to 3.1.14 (or a later 3.1.x version) or 3.2.7 (or a later 3.2.x
version) from a previous Rudder version, this feature is disabled by default
in order to mitigate any risk of undesired side effects on existing
installations. You can enable it in the Administration/Settings page, using the
*Enable node properties expansion in Directives* switch.

Rudder installations from 4.0.0 onwards have this feature enabled by default.

=== Usage

In any directive text field, you can access properties defined on nodes using the following syntax:

----

${node.properties[property_name][key_one][key_two]}

----


where:

- `property_name` is the name of the property defined via the API
- `key_one` and `key_two` are keys in the JSON structure
- the value obtained is the string representation, in compact mode, of the entire node property or sub-structure of the JSON value
- if the key is not found, an error will be raised that will stop policy generation
- spaces are authorized around separators ([,],|,}..)

==== Providing a default value

Most of the time, you will need to provide a default value to node properties expansion to avoid a policy generation
error due to missing node properties.
This is also a good case to allow a simple override mechanism for a parameter where only some nodes have a specific value.

You can also use other node properties, or other Rudder parameters as defaults, using the same syntax as above.

Some examples:

----

${node.properties[datacenter][id] | default = "LON2" }
${node.properties[datacenter][name] | default = """Co-location with "Hosting Company" in Paris (allows quotes)""" }
${node.properties[datacenter][id] | default = ${rudder.param.default_datacenter} }
${node.properties[netbios_name] | default = ${rudder.node.hostname} }
${node.properties[dns_suffix] | default = ${node.properties[datacenter][dns_suffix] | default = "${rudder.node.hostname}.example.com" }

#or even use cfengine variables in the default
${node.properties[my_override] | default = "${cfengine.key}"}

----

==== Forcing expansion on the node

In some cases, you will want to use a `${node.properties[key]}` in a directive parameter, but you don't want to expand it during
policy generation on the Rudder server, but instead let the value be expanded during the agent run on the node. Typically if the value is to be used by a templating
tool, or if the value is known only on the node.

For these cases, you can add the "node" option to the property expression:

----

${node.properties[datacenter][id] | node }

----

This will be rewritten during policy generation into:

----

${node.properties[datacenter][id]}

----

Which will be considered as a standard variable by the agent, which will replaced this expression by its value if it's defined, or kept as is if it's unknown.

The variable content is read from `/var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs/properties.d/properties.json`, and from the optionally defined `/var/rudder/local/properties.d/*.json` files.
You can find more information on node properties in xref:usage:advanced_configuration_management.adoc#_node_properties[node properties documentation].


== JavaScript evaluation in Directives

It is possible to use JavaScript expressions to build Directive values. The
resulting values will be computed during policy generation, and can therefore
provide unique values for each node.

=== Feature availability

If you upgraded from a version prior to 3.1.12 or 3.2.5, this feature is disabled by default
in order to mitigate any risk of undesired side effects on existing
installations. You can enable it in the Administration/Settings page, using the
*Enable script evaluation in Directives* parameter.

Rudder installations from 4.0 onwards have this feature enabled by default.

=== Usage

All standard JavaScript methods are available, and a Rudder-specific
library, prefixed with `rudder.` also provides some extra utilities. This
library is documented below.

For example, to get the first 3 letters of each node's hostname, you can write:
----
"${rudder.node.hostname}".substring(0,3)
----

[TIP]

[[limits-of-scripts, Limitation of the scripting language]]

.Limitation of the scripting language

====

JavaScript expressions are evaluated in a sandboxed JavaScript environment. It has some
limitations, such as:

* It cannot write on the filesystem
* Scripts are killed after 5 seconds of execution, to prevent overloading the system

====

=== Rudder utility library

==== Standard hash methods

The following methods allow to simply hash a value using standard algorithms:

* `rudder.hash.md5(string)`
* `rudder.hash.sha256(string)`
* `rudder.hash.sha512(string)`

These methods do not use a salt for hashing, and as such are not suitable for
distributing passwords for user accounts on UNIX systems. See below for a
preferable approach for this.

==== UNIX password-compatible hash methods

The following methods are specially designed to provided hashes that can be
used as user passwords on UNIX systems (in `/etc/shadow`, for example). Use
these if you want to distribute hashes of unique passwords for each of your
nodes, for example.

Two different cases exist: support for generic Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD,
...) and support for AIX systems (which use a different hash algorithm).

Available methods are:

* `rudder.password.auto(algorithm, password [, salt])`
* `rudder.password.unix(algorithm, password [, salt])`
* `rudder.password.aix(algorithm, password [, salt])`

The parameters are:

* `algorithm` can be "MD5", "SHA-512", "SHA512", "SHA-256", "SHA256" (case insensitive)
* `password` is the plain text password to hash
* `salt` is the optional salt to use in the password (we *strongly* recommend providing this value - see warning below)

The `unix` method generates Unix crypt password compatible hashes (for use on
Linux, BSD, etc), while the `aix` method generates AIX password compatible
hashes. The `auto` method automatically uses the appropriate algorithm for
each node type (AIX nodes will have a AIX compatible hash, others will
have a Unix compatible hash). We recommend always using `auto` for simplicity.

For example, to use the first 8 letters of each node's hostname as a password,
you could write:
----
rudder.password.auto("SHA-256", "${rudder.node.hostname}".substring(0,8), "abcdefg")
----

[WARNING]

.Providing a salt

====

It is strongly recommended to provide a *salt* to the methods above. If no
salt is provided, a random salt is created, and will be recreated at each
policy generation, causing the resulting hashes to change each time. This, in
turn, will generate an unnecessary "repaired" status for the password component on all nodes
at each policy generation.

====

[TIP]

.JVM requirements

====

This features is tested only on HotSpot 1.7 and 1.8, OpenJDK 1.7 and 1.8,
IBM JVM 1.7 and 1.8.

====

[TIP]

.JVM requirements for AIX password hashes

====

AIX password generation depends on the availability of *PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256* and
*PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512* in the JVM. These algorithms are included by default on
HotSpot 1.8 and OpenJDK 1.8 and upward. In the case where your JVM does not support these
algorithms, typically on an IBM JDK or a JVM 1.7 version of HotSpot and OpenJDK, the hashing
algorithm falls back to *SHA1* with *PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1*, and an error message will be
logged. You can also check your JVM editor manual to add support for these algorithms.

====

=== Status and future support

In a future version of Rudder, JavaScript evaluation will be supported in all
fields in Directives.

In the meantime, you can already test this functionality out by entering a JavaScript
expression in any Directive field, prefixed by "evaljs:". Please be aware that
this is unsupported and untested, so do this at your own risk.

If you do encounter any issues, please get in touch or open a ticket - we'd
love to hear about them!

There is currently no plan to extend this support to the fields in the
Technique editor.

[[_server_event_hooks]]
== Server Event Hooks

Rudder 4.1 introduces the possibility to execute files (hooks), typically scripts,
when some predefined event occurs on Rudder.

include::{partialsdir}/dyn/hooks.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


== New directives default naming scheme

When a new directive is created, by default the 'Name' field is filled
with the Technique name. For example, if you create a new Directive from
the 'Users' Technique, the Name field will get the value: "Users".

This not always what you want, especially for your custom Techniques. So you
have the possibility to define new default values for Name, at Technique or
at Technique and Version granularity.

This is done by adding or updating the file:
`/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/default-directive-names.conf`.

That file need to be commited in git, and the Technique library reloaded
to take effect:

----
cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/
vi default-directive-names.conf
 ....
git add default-directive-names.conf
git commit -m "Change default names for new directives"
rudder server reload-techniques
----

The file format is a simple `techniqueId[/optionalVersion]: default name to use` format.
The Technique ID is the name of the directory containing the Technique version directory
in `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques`.

For example, if we imagine that in your company, you have the internal
convention to create one directive by user role with the login in the
name, you would prefer to have a default value to:

----
Role <user-role>: <matching-login>
----

And then, for Users Technique version 7, you changed your mind and now
use the scheme:

----
Role: [user-role] (with login [login])
----

Then the file will look like:

----
# Default pattern for new directive from "userManagement" technique:
userManagement= Role <user-role>: <matching-login>

# For userManagement version 2.0, prefer that pattern in new Directives:
userManagement/7.0: Role: [user-role] (with login [login])
----


== Directives ordering

Configuration in Rudder are based on desired states, describing the expected state of the system. However, there are cases where having order is desirable (like ensuring that a JVM is present before deploying an Application server, or ensuring a user is present before setting it sudoers), even if it will converge over the course of several agent runs.

In Rudder, there is two separated ways to order things, depending the type of Technique". So, before that, we need to explain how Policies are generated on the
agent from Directives based on the same Technique.

=== Policy generation and Directive merge

In Rudder, Policies are generated from Directives, but several Directives based on the same Technique always lead to *one* Policy on the agent.
For unique (non multi-instance) Technique, the one with the highest priority is selected. For multi-instance Technique, the different Directive values are *merged*
into one Policy after having been sorted.

.Separated Policy Generation in Rudder 4.3
[TIP]
=====
 In Rudder 4.3, that limitation is lifted and Technique can be made to generate ONE Policy for each Directive. That capacity is controled by the
 `POLICYGENERATION` tag, where the value `merged` is the pre-4.3 default behavior, and values `separated` or `separated-with-param` lead to one Policy per Directive.

 See https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/10625[Don't merge directive from same technique on generation] for more information.
=====


=== Sorting Directives based on the *same* Technique

For Directive based on the same Technique, the sort order is based on the *Priority* value of the Directive. Between two Directive, the one with the highest *Priority*
is the first:

- for a *non* multi-instance Technique, it means that it is there is only one that is chosen in the resulting Policies (the others are discared),
- for a multi-instance Technique, it means that the variables in the Policy will be declared and check in sorting order of Directives (so the first Directive's
  variables will be declared in first position and check first during an agent run).

If several *Directives* have the same *Priority*, the *Rule name*, and then the *Directive name* are used for sorting in alphanumeric order.

.Priority field value and meaning
[WARNING]
======
The *Priority* field of a Directive used to be a number, from 0 to 10, where 0 means "highest priority".
This changed with https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/11725 but if you knew Rudder before that change, please
use "0" whenever the documentation says "highest priority".
======


==== Special use case: overriding generic_variable_definition

You can use the merging of Directive to define variable override with the "Generic Variable Definition" Technique.

For example, let say you want to define a *DNS* variable with default value *[default dns]* and on some node case,
a value *[overrided dns]*:

- Create a Directive [1] with *high* priority: it will be your *default* case, so set *DNS* to *[default dns]*.
- Create an other Directive [2] with *lower* priority: it will be you specialized case, so set *DNS* to *[overrided dns]*.

Then, a node with only Directive [1] will have the default value defined, and a node with both Directives will have the overriding one.

It works because on the agent, you can redeclare a variable name and reassign to it a new value: the last one wins (so in our case, the *less* prioritary).


=== Sorting Policies

Rudder uses a best-effort method for ordering Policies, based on alphanumeric ordering of the corresponding Rule, then Directive name.

When several Directive were merged, Rudder choose the first (Rule name, Directive name) as the ordering value to use for the resulting Policy.


.Best practice
[TIP]
=====
You should always start Rules and Directives name by 2 (or 3) digits to be able to easily reorder Policy evaluation if the need happen:

Do not use: "My general security rule" and "Check ssh configuration"

But use: "05. My general security rule" and "40. Check ssh configuration"
=====

=== Example

- given three Techniques A, B and C
- directives A1 and A2 based on Technique A, directives B1 and B2 based on B, directives C1 and C2 based on C
- all Directives have the same priority,
- rule R0 having [C1], R1 having [A1, B2] and rule R2 having [A2, B1, C2], all applied on a same node,
- merging (R0, C1) and (R2, C2) => [C1, C2] and keep (R0, C1) as Policy order
- merging (R1, A1) and (R2, A2) => [A1, A2] and keep (R1, A1) as Policy order,
- merging (R1, B2) and (R2, B1) => [B2, B1] (because R1 < R2) and keep (R1, B2) for policy order,
- so policies are sort: (R0, C1) then (R1, A1) then (R1, B2)
- resulting ordering of directive's values will be: [C1, C2] then [A1, A2] then [B1, B2]

== Share files between nodes

Rudder 4.1 introduced a way to share files from one node to another.
It allows a node to send a file to its relay, which will make it available
for another target node, that has to to specifically download it.

This file sharing method is secured by:

* The control of uploaded file signature by the server, to check it matches the source node's private key.
* The same mechanism as standard file copy in Rudder to download the shared file from the server.

It also includes a ttl mechanism that allows sharing a file for a limited amount of time.

To use this feature, two generic methods are available in the technique editor:

* xref:reference:generic_methods.adoc#sharedfile_from_node[sharedfile_from_node]: To download a file shared from another node.
* xref:reference:generic_methods.adoc#sharedfile_to_node[sharedfile_to_node]: To make a file available to another node.

See the documentation of these methods for details about the required parameters,
and especially xref:reference:generic_methods.adoc#sharedfile_to_node[sharedfile_to_node] for a complete usage example.
