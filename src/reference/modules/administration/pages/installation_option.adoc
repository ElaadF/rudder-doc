= Server installation options

== Installation modifiers with environment variables

There are two environment variables that can be set to change specific part of the installation

=== Do not edit /etc/sudoers file at installation

On RPM-based system (SLES, CentOS and RedHat), Rudder server installation validates that the `/etc/sudoers` file contains the line

----

#includedir /etc/sudoers.d

----

If this file shouldn't be changed during installation, you should set the environment variable RUDDER_NO_SUDOERS_EDIT to 1

----

export RUDDER_NO_SUDOERS_EDIT=1

----

=== Do not modify system Techniques at upgrade

During its upgrade, Rudder automatically upgrade and commit the system Techniques. These Techniques are necessary to maintain Rudder, and need to be synchronized with Rudder.
If you don't want to commit automatically the system Techniques, you should set the environment variable RUDDER_NO_TECHNIQUE_AUTOCOMMIT to 1.

----

export RUDDER_NO_TECHNIQUE_AUTOCOMMIT=1

----

You will have to commit the Techniques after the installation to ensure that Rudde works as expected

----

cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/system
git add .
git commit -m "Upgrade system Techniques"
