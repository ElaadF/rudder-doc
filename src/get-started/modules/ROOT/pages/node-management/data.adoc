= Providing configuration data

For now we have only manipulated statically defined information, may it be for group definition or
inside the configuration itself. This is the simplest use-case, but Rudder allows
to easily define and use dynamic data.

== Separating data from code

[NOTE]

====

In this section we will see:

* how to attach data to each node
* how to use it for group definition
* how to use it inside configuration policies

====

Rudder has basically three types of variable data:

* Global parameters that apply to the whole Rudder instance
* Variables defined inside the configuration policies, associated to a set of groups
* Variables associated to a node

We will here use the last one to define a property for our node.
Go to the node details, for example using the quick search bar,
and go to the *Properties* tab. This is a small key-value database associated to each node.

Define an *env = production* variable.

Then click on the plus sign to add the property.

We now have associated a new property to our node.
Let's use it to define a group of production boxes.

== Classify nodes using node properties

Go to the groups page, and create the *Production nodes* group,
defined by:

image::./production.png["Definition of the production group", align="center"]

It should contain our `node` machine.

We will also start defining data for the next policy we will build,
still for the `node` machine.

Let's define a JSON property called `website` (you need to set its type to `JSON`),
with the following content:

[source,json]
----
{
  "webroot": "/var/www/html",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "port": 8080
}
----


This will be translated in the configuration of a website we will do on the
`node` machine in the next part of this tutorial.

As you can already see, this property is a JSON object, which allows us to define more advanced
variables with a hierarchical content.

To sum things up:

* Rudder has rich variables features
* Variables can be scalar or hierarchical objects
* Variables can be defined on the server: globally, by policy or by node
* Node variables can be used for business-oriented classification
* Variables can also be defined locally, during agent execution, to use local data
