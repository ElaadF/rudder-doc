= Apply a complete applicative policy

Now we have defined our technique, we will apply it.
To do so, got to the directives page (*Configuration management -> Directives*)
and find our new technique (for example by using the filter with "Website"),
and create a directive.

This times our technique takes parameters, so we have to provide them:

image::./technique-parameters.png["Parameters for our website technique", align="center"]

We are using node properties here (the one we have defined in TODO).

The syntax to use to access them is `${node.properties[property_name]}`.
Here we have hierarchical json, so we access a subkey with `${node.properties[property_name][subkey]}`.

Then you can see the rules zone at the bottom of the page.
It allows quickly linking a directive to a rule, as it is a common task in Rudder.

We will use it and select our "Demo Website" rule, then save the directive.
