= Define a complete applicative policy

[NOTE]

====

In this section, you will learn:

* How to define more advanced configuration policies
* How to link different components, using conditionnal
  evaluation of methods.
* How to define and use techniques with parameters

====

In the first part, we defined a very simple technique
that managed a user.

We will go back to the technique editor and create a technique
to configure a small website, that will consist of nginx installation,
deployment of a minimal configuration and an html file as our website.

Let's call our new technique "Static website".

This time, we will add parameters to this technique.
What are parameters? Just like we saw in the built-in techniques, you can pass parameters to techniques created in the technique editor. They are part of the technique
definition, and their value is usable with the `${variable_name}` syntax.

We will need two parameters:

* A domain for our site, called `domain`
* A port to listen on, called `port`

image::./parameters.png["Technique parameters", align="center"]

Then we can start assembling our building blocks. We want:

* to install nginx
* to manage the nginx service
* to manage nginx configuration file
* to add our website content

We will now map it to generic methods:

* "Package present" with the "nginx" parameter
* "Service started" with the "nginx" parameter

Four our website content, we will use a simple:

* "File content" with the html content of our website

And for the configuration file:

* "File from a mustache string": use a template for the configuration of the nginx service

Which looks strange, but don't worry, nothing complicated here.

Let's start with the easy part, with the nginx setup.

Add a package present. You can skip all parameters except the package
name, defaults are ok for us.

image::./nginx-package.png["Install nginx package", align="center"]

And for the service

Now let's define our website content:

TODO

And correct it permission to 644 

Now we are only missing a configuration file.

Let's add a template

[NOTE]

====

Templating allows replacing content in a generic template with
specific data. The include environement conditions or varaibles.

It is generally a good practice to enforce the content of file totally, either by templating or hardcoded file than to
use file editions, as they define an absolute state and are hence a lot easier to use and more reliable.

====

Let's add this configuration file:

----
server {
    root /var/www/html;
    server_name {{{domain}}};
    listen {{{port}}};
}
----

In the destination /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

TODO

We have now defined all of our configuration states! But are we done yet? Not exactly,
as we are missing an important piece: restarting the service when the configuration changes.

You can spot it is a bit different compared to our other methods: in this case
it is not a state but an action we need to express.

The technique editor has a concept of conditions. What are conditions?

[NOTE]

====

A *condition* is represented by a string, and can be either defined or not.
The conditions express what the current execution environment is:

* We are on a Debian 9 system
* The state of the nginx package is correct
* The content of the configuration file has just been modified
* etc.

We can use conditions to limit the evaluation of a method to a specific context,
for example only on debian 9 or only when a given file has been modified by the agent.

This allows:

* using actions (like service restart) by limiting them to a specific context
* writing generic policies compatible with different operating systems, by having specific parts for each

====

[NOTE]

====

Every method will define a *result condition* that is one of the conditions displayed
in method details

image::./result-conditions.png["Install nginx package conditions", align="center"]

It can be:

* *Success*: When the state was already compliant
* *Repaired*: When the state has been modofied by the agent to become compliant
* *Error*: When the expected state could not be reached

====


In our case the condition will be the modification of the configuration file:

TODO

[NOTE]

====

Conditions can be combinated using boolean operators:

* `!` for *not*
* `|` for *or*
* `.` for *and*
* `(` and `)` for grouping

====


[NOTE]

====

When you start using conditions, be careful to only use them when necessary.
For example, we could imagine only deploying our website when installing the package.

This is less reliable as we would stop checking for this symlink, and always
consider it ok.

In short: Checking configuration is cheap, only add conditions when strictly necessary.
