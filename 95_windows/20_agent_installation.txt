[[dsc-agent-installation]]
=== Install Windows DSC agent

The installation and upgrade processes are exactly the same.
Download the *exe* file, and run, on your node:

----

rudder-agent-dsc-<Rudder version>-<plugin version>.exe	

----

The installer will ask you the policy server to use.
If a policy server is already configured (for example during upgrade), you can leave this field empty.

The installer will install the agent files and create the scheduled
tasks to run the agent and the the inventory.

If you want to do an automated unattended installation, you can re-configure the policy server in:

----
C:\Program Files\Rudder\etc\policy-server.conf
----

Before running the installer with:

----

rudder-agent-dsc-<Rudder version>-<plugin version>.exe \S

----

This will install the agent without asking questions.
