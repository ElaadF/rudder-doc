[[node-supported-os, the list of supported Operating Systems for Nodes]]

==== Fully supported Operating Systems

Fully supported Operating Systems are systems that are frequently built and tested on our servers.
Partially suported Operating Systems are systems that have been built and tested at least once but that have not seen continuous flow of fixes.

===== For Rudder Nodes

The following operating systems are supported for Rudder Nodes and packages are
available for these platforms:

GNU/Linux:

* Debian 5 to 9

.Windows and AIX Nodes

====

* On Windows, installing Rudder requires the commercial version of CFEngine (named CFEngine Enterprise)
* For IBM AIX, pre-built RPM packages are distributed by Normation only

Hence, as a starting point, we suggest that you only use Linux machines. Once
you are accustomed to Rudder, contact Normation to obtain a demo version for
these platforms.
